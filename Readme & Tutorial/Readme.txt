Udon Toolbox (by "Hitori Ou").
Downloaded from www.github.com/HitoriOu/UdonToolbox/releases

A collection of U# scripts that are easy to understand and use (for Udon worlds on "VR Chat"). 
For free use/modification allowed.

You will need U# for the code/scripts to work, download latest version from here.
https://github.com/Merlin-san/UdonSharp/releases

Many of these are designed to function as the old trigger system from the SDK2, 
meaning the component for buttons/triggers/colliders may have to be on the same game object the script is on and that it need collider/trigger components (or other required).

------------ Please Note the following: ------------
Do not edit the code in the original file (updated versions will overwrite it).
If you want to modify the code then make a copy of it with a unique "class name" to edit instead.
If you do edit the code/copy of it, please make a note of this in the code (a simple edited/modified by "name" in the dev notes/summary will suffice).
Updated versions might have a replacement file with a updated name (will be noted in the readme file if so), in this case you have to setup using the new file version if you want/need the update.
All codes are provided as "work in progress" i try clear all bugs and test but some issues will slip by me.
If you want to credit the use of the toolbox feel free to do so (with link/adress to github provided).

------------ Usefull Rules to be aware of: ------------
1: Network synched events/scripts (global) will not work in "play mode", have to actually be inside VRchat to test those (made automated code to take care of this, so never mind this rule).
2: When a component/object parameter for a Udon script is left empty it default to the object the script is on (can cause errors if empty, depending on script design).
3: Udon Scripts are handeled locally according to object, network synch is also per object basis. Only exception is if a global variable targets a Udon script on a different Game object. So any duplicate using the same script are regarded as a seperate instance/script despite sharing a common Udon "Program Source".
4: pickup object events might not trigger if Autohold is not toggeled to "Yes"

------------ Variable naming convention: ------------
Note: Will be migrating over to a new format that does not use "_" signs (sorry if this ends up confusing people).
